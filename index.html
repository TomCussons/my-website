      <h1>Hello, I'm Thomas Cussons</h1>
      <p><br>I am a experienced Fraud and Risk banking professional, with over 9 years experience working for HSBC <br><br> </p>
	  <p>I am now seeking employment after recently moving to the United States of America on a Fiance visa (Yes I had to get married in 90 days ... like the 
		TV show!)<br></p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><br>I have multiple years experience in the following coding languages: <br><br></p>
	
	<p class="highlight-text">SAS</p>

			<p>
				11+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I started learning SAS during my Mathematics degree at Sheffield Hallam University. I continued to expand my knowledge in this coding languages
				during my tenure at HSBC, receiving training from SAS and then passing this knowledge on as a mentor in HSBC's internal SAS academy.
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
	<p class="highlight-text">SQL</p>

			<p>
				8+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I developed my SQL skills utilising the SAS implementation, after 3-4 years of perfecting the coding language, I became the SQL specific mentor within
				the SAS academy.
				<br>
				I am proficient in using SQL to connect to large databases (Oracle, GCP, Teradata), and effectively make use of subqueries, in-line views and partitioning.
			</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			
			
	<p class="highlight-text">Python</p>

			<p>
				4+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I have self taught myself python utilising various online tools. This was due to personal development and a future transition for HSBC from SAS to Python.
				<br>
				Due to HSBC's upcoming change, and my experience in SAS, Python and mentoring, I created a SAS to Python programming guide.
				<br>
				This guide went through the data manipulation and analytics that would be used in peoples day to day jobs. This course was delivered and taught virtually to 200+ colleagues across the globe by myself.
			</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			
	<p class="highlight-text">VBA</p>

			<p>
				11+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				My final year project, evacuation simulation using cellular automata, was built within VBA due to the visualization capabilities of Excel.
				<br>
				I then used my VBA knowledge to automate several processes within my professional career. I then went on and built a VBA training guide, showing the basic functionality that would be needed (such as
				 opening files from dynamic referencing, Userforms, copy & pasting content, saving files and delivering user messages). This was delivered internally to 50+ colleagues.
