    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am from the UK. More specifically Yorkshire (Grew up in Humberside, and then moved to Sheffield for University and lived there for 10 years).<br><br>
	I studied mathematics, and specialised in statistics as I knew I wanted to pursue a analytical career.<br><br>
	I took a placement year during my time at University to work for HSBC, I stayed with this company for 8.5 years across numerous roles.<br><br>
	<br>
	I then met my wife, Allyson Cussons, who was based in Michigan USA.<br>
	I got engaged in December 2022, and started the long process of moving across to the States.<br>
	<br>
	It has been a long journey, but in November 2024 I emigrated to the United States on a K1 Visa, got married on December 2024 (Had to within 90 days!), got a puppy (Called Crumpet)
	and a house in Lansing MI (as she was a noisy puppy, wasnt fair on the neighbours)

	<br>
	<br>
	Currently seeking employment. I have my Employment Authorisation Document and SSN in hand so can legally work as of May 2025. My Green Card application is under review, expected within the next
	couple of months. No sponsorship needed!

    <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
    <p><br>I have multiple years experience in the following coding languages: <br><br></p>
	
	<p class="highlight-text">SAS</p>

			<p>
				11+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I started learning SAS during my Mathematics degree at Sheffield Hallam University. I continued to expand my knowledge in this coding languages
				during my tenure at HSBC, receiving training from SAS and then passing this knowledge on as a mentor in HSBC's internal SAS academy.
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
	<p class="highlight-text">SQL</p>

			<p>
				8+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I developed my SQL skills utilising the SAS implementation, after 3-4 years of perfecting the coding language, I became the SQL specific mentor within
				the SAS academy.
				<br>
				I am proficient in using SQL to connect to large databases (Oracle, GCP, Teradata), and effectively make use of subqueries, in-line views and partitioning.
			</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			
			
	<p class="highlight-text">Python</p>

			<p>
				4+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				I have self taught myself python utilising various online tools. This was due to personal development and a future transition for HSBC from SAS to Python.
				<br>
				Due to HSBC's upcoming change, and my experience in SAS, Python and mentoring, I created a SAS to Python programming guide.
				<br>
				This guide went through the data manipulation and analytics that would be used in peoples day to day jobs. This course was delivered and taught virtually to 200+ colleagues across the globe by myself.
			</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			
	<p class="highlight-text">VBA</p>

			<p>
				11+ Years of overall experience.<br>
				<br>
				My final year project, evacuation simulation using cellular automata, was built within VBA due to the visualization capabilities of Excel.
				<br>
				I then used my VBA knowledge to automate several processes within my professional career. I then went on and built a VBA training guide, showing the basic functionality that would be needed (such as
				 opening files from dynamic referencing, Userforms, copy & pasting content, saving files and delivering user messages). This was delivered internally to 50+ colleagues.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
	<h4><u>Work</u></h4>
	<p>
	I led various large projects during my time at HSBC, using a variety of coding languages. Below shows a couple of highlights:<br><br>
	
	<h5>GCP Data Restructure</h5>
	<br>
		During HSBC's transition from SAS EFM to Feedzai, there was also a transition of data storage (from Teradata to GCP). Part of this move involved all transactional and behavioural data, 
		this was initially deployed as one large dataset. Due to my concerns about data integrity and digestibility, I did a deep dive into the before and after costs.<br>
		
		This structure was sub-optimal, and I found that the costs to this were growing exponentially. I led a project for an entire new data structure, which led to faster and more cost-efficient
		cloud based data queries. This had an <strong> estimated saving of ~$1 Million per product per region per year.</strong>
	<br><br>
	<h5>Time Sheets - Entirely within VBA</h5>
	<br>
		The head of RCR analytics approached and asked me to build an internal time sheet for 100+ colleagues within the department. This needed to be: Uneditable after 2 weeks, private (everybody had their
		own account and password), allow multiple users to access and update at the same time, easy to use and feed into a managers dashboard for their own analytics.<br>
		I was approached on this due to my efficiency within Excel and VBA.<br>
		Within two weeks I managed to get the first version deployed, with all the key functionality achieved. This was entirely built within Excel and VBA.<br>
		Numerous iterations  and version upgrades were implemented on.<br> I then trained and handed over the responsibility and maintenance to other colleagues as I moved on within my career.
	<br><br>
	<h5>Cross Product - Strategy Revamp</h5>
	<br>
		During my time within the Loans Acquisition team, I led a cross-department project to "Revamp" every products acquisition code.<br>
		When I initially joined the team, each product and brand had their own strategy codes. Large portions of these codes and rules were meant to be exactly the same cross product (i.e. the affordability calculations,
		 bad bureau rules etc), however there were numerous misalignments causing unnecessary confusion and errors.<br>
		Due to my efficient and readable style of SAS, SQL & Macro coding, I redesigned the entirety of the HSBC loans code, making strong use of global and local macros. I then utilised the macros for M&S and finally
		First Direct. This then grew to be used and implemented for the other products within the department (Credit Cards & Current Accounts). <i>Note: Brands were also split by channel</i><br>
		The end result of this project was having one universal source code that is now referenced by multiple strategies, meaning that any change requests only had one source to change rather than several.
		It also made analysts "Brand and Product agnostic", as multiple strategy rules and components were now fully aligned, allowing a analyst to switch between them with more ease.

	<h4><u>Other</u></h4>
    <p>I have been working on completing numerous Leetcode problems to expand my python knowledge. Please follow the following link to see my portfolio of answers:  to_be_added</p>
	<br>
	<p>My final year project at University focussed on the different evacuation scenarios, and built a simulation in order to find the most statistically significant factors in a timely and successful evacuation.
	This was done entirely within VBA. A copy of my report, and the Excel-based simulation can be found in the following link: to_be_added</p>
